# Manipulator-robot
Programmed Lego Mindstorms EV3 manipulator robot on Matlab to execute pick and place tasks on stations with dynamic heights. -reading the heights of different stations using an ultrasonic sensor. and computing rotation angles by inverse kinematics methodologies.


In this project, you will remotely access the manipulator in Figure 1 and program it in MATLAB to achieve a pick-and-place sequence of motions. The entire arm is driven by three motors: 
• Motor A 
• Motor B 
• Motor C 
In addition to the three actuators, the system has six sensors: 
• Touch sensor #1 (See Figure 2) 
• Touch sensor #2 (See Figure 2) 
. Ultrasonic sensor 
• Motor A encoder 
• Motor B encoder 
• Motor C encoder

The stations are 90 degress apart from each other with varying heights and the objective is to pick and place an object through predetermined paths or according to the input given by the user.
